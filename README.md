****Knock to Unlock****
,the Door Unlock System by Knocking is an innovative and secure method of accessing doors without the need for traditional keys or electronic keycards. It offers a convenient and user-friendly alternative by allowing users to unlock doors by simply knocking on them in a specific pattern.



****Introduction:****
  The system aims to enhance security and convenience in residential, commercial, and various other settings. It utilizes advanced technology to detect and analyze knocking patterns, making it a unique and efficient access control solution.



**Components:**

**1. Piezo Sensor:** This sound-detection device detects knocking vibrations and converts them into electrical signals.

**2. Microcontroller:** The brain of the system, it processes the input from the piezo sensor and makes decisions based on predefined knocking patterns.

**3. Solenoid Lock:** An electric lock that physically locks and unlocks the door.

**4. Power Source:** Typically powered by batteries or external power, providing the energy needed to operate the system.


**Working:**
User knocks on the door with a certain pattern.
Piezo sensor detects vibrations and converts them into electrical signals.
Microcontroller analyzes the signals to match against pre-programmed knocking patterns.
If a correct pattern is recognized, the microcontroller activates the solenoid lock, unlocking the door.

**Advantages:**

Convenience: Users can easily unlock doors without carrying keys or remembering access codes.

Security: The knocking pattern is unique and difficult to replicate, enhancing security.

Cost-Effective: It offers a cost-effective solution compared to advanced electronic access systems.
